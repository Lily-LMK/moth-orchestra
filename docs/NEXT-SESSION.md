# Next session

Note that "family" means two different things in these notes. The section
immediately below concerns **taxonomic** families. Everything from "A new
instrument family" onward concerns **instrument** families — voices. They are
unrelated pieces of work.

## Start here — a curated vernacular-name lookup

Agreed with Lily on 16 September 2026, after the import repair
([SESSION-2026-09-16-IMPORT.md](SESSION-2026-09-16-IMPORT.md)), and refined by
her the same day.

Common names now come from iNaturalist alone. The third-party enrichment that
used to fill the gaps was removed: it cost about 65 minutes per import and
walked up the ranks as far as kingdom, so a record could be labelled "Animals".
Nothing fills the gap now, by design.

### The rule

**Prefer the taxonomic family. Climb to superfamily when the family has no
honest vernacular name. Stop there.**

This is Lily's rule and it is a better one than "family only", which is what
this document said first. Her reasoning: *"Even if an owlet moth has a species
name, it is still an owlet moth."* A superfamily name is a true statement about
the specimen, not a guess. She would be glad to photograph an unidentified
moth and see "owlet moth".

The floor matters more than the ceiling. Family and superfamily are the ranks
where Lepidoptera actually carry vernacular names. Above them the names stop
informing — order gives "moths and butterflies", class "insects", kingdom
"animals". That emptiness, not the climbing itself, is what made the removed
behaviour dishonest.

### Names must sound vernacular, and be singular

"Owlet moth", not "owlet moths". Not "Erebid moths" — a latinate coinage
wearing a vernacular coat, and the mistake this document made on its first
pass. If there is no name a person would actually say, climb; if there is
still none, leave the scientific name alone.

### Why climbing earns its place — measured, not assumed

Against the two-backyards export. 4,153 records carry no common name; all but 7
have a family, and 3,972 have a superfamily.

| Level | Curated entries | Records covered | Share of gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Family | 10 | 2,345 | 56% |
| Family | 25 | 3,051 | 73% |
| Family | 50 | 3,539 | 85% |
| **Superfamily** | **10** | **2,888** | **69%** |
| **Superfamily** | **20** | **3,350** | **80%** |

Superfamily is often both fewer entries and truer names:

| Superfamily | Records | Families beneath | Vernacular |
|---|---|---|---|
| Noctuoidea | 762 | 6 — Erebidae, Noctuidae, Nolidae, Notodontidae… | owlet moth |
| Pyraloidea | 534 | 2 — Crambidae, Pyralidae | snout moth |
| Gelechioidea | 488 | 10 — Oecophoridae, Depressariidae, Xyloryctidae… | curved-horn moth |
| Geometroidea | 452 | 2 — Geometridae, Uraniidae | — prefer family |
| Tortricoidea | 164 | 1 — Tortricidae | leafroller moth |

Noctuoidea is the case that proves the rule: one entry covers 762 records, and
covers them better than three family entries would, because Erebidae is exactly
the family with no honest vernacular.

Names in that last column are **suggestions for Lily to judge**, not decided.
Vernacular naming is her expertise, and the first pass of this document got
Erebidae wrong precisely by not deferring to it.

Where the family has the better name, use it: Formicidae → "ant",
Cerambycidae → "longhorn beetle", Geometridae → "geometer moth". 174 records
have a family but no superfamily, so family entries remain necessary either way.

**Start with roughly 20 entries across both levels.** That reaches about 80% of
the gap and is an afternoon of careful naming.

### Constraints

- **No network access.** The point is that it is local, instant and inspectable.
- **Never climb above superfamily.** Order, class and kingdom carry no name
  worth showing.
- **Record where the name came from.** Lily is content for a superfamily name
  to appear as the record's name, so this is not a display constraint. But the
  data model should keep the rank the name came from — a record should know it
  is showing a Noctuoidea name rather than its own — so provenance survives
  into exports and the presentation can change later without re-deriving
  anything. Cheap now, impossible to add retrospectively.
- Keep the table as **data, not code**, so Lily can extend it without touching
  logic.
- Applied **only** where iNaturalist supplies no common name. It never
  overrides a real one.

Settled: where neither family nor superfamily has an entry, the scientific name
stands alone, as now.

## A new instrument family for the gallery

Read [PLAN-NEXT-FAMILY.md](PLAN-NEXT-FAMILY.md) first. It carries the measured
case for a large palette, the naming question to settle with Lily before
building, the three-strata proposal, the headroom problem that must be
measured before any sub-bass is added, and the four answers needed from Lily to
start.

---

## Start here — Gondwana, second attempt, unheard

The first palette (fifteen physical-model bodies, rank-graded) was built and
rejected by ear the same day: *"a child's xylophone or panhand"*. The diagnosis
and the rebuild are both in
[SESSION-2026-09-13-GONDWANA.md](SESSION-2026-09-13-GONDWANA.md) — read it
before touching this family, because the failure is more instructive than the
fix.

What stands now: seven bodies, not fifteen. Rank is spent *inside* each voice
rather than on more voices. The family performs the written score an octave or
two below where it was written, always by whole octaves. And it sounds into a
synthesised room on its own bus — the first reverb this instrument has ever had.

Audition: `../../sessions/2026-09-13/gondwana-2/listen.html` — run
`python3 serve.py` in that folder first. The first attempt is kept at
`../../sessions/2026-09-13/gondwana/` for comparison.

**Nothing has been judged by ear.** Gondwana stays in `WITHHELD_VOICE_MODES`
alongside Noctilucent; no visitor can reach it. Two questions the measurements
raise but cannot answer: whether this is a wise voice or merely a slower one,
and whether `gond_rim` — the only light left on top, and among the quietest —
survives the mass underneath.

Steps 2 to 5 — the ground, the floor, the gallery/personal mix, the release
decision — are unstarted. Playback is headphones only.

## Standing state — the interface

Lantern Glass is published. `main` carries it; GitHub Pages serves the root of
`main`. Noctilucent is built, tested and deliberately withheld from the
listener. Suite: 200 pass, zero fail, one documented skip, eight gap TODOs.

Read SESSION-ROADMAP.md and SESSION-2026-09-13-RELEASE.md first. This session
is stage two of the interface work Lily asked for: the shell around the
instrument, not the instrument. Protect the sound, the score, the creek
flourish, A-plain/B-outlined and shared taxonomic ring positions.

## The concrete outcome

One interface that genuinely resolves at three sizes rather than shrinking:
an exhibition screen read at a distance and running unattended, Lily's laptop
while she performs it in front of a room, and a phone held one-handed in the
dark at the moth sheet. Lily chose all three, properly responsive.

## Start here — Lily's eyes on the shared minute

See SESSION-2026-09-13-SHARED.md. Shared minutes now show both records; they
never reached the card at all before. The centre card has an off switch (C),
and the control column was rebuilt as a specification sheet.

Still unchecked: the gallery fullscreen view under the new design layer, and
Present/demo mode. Nothing has been judged by ear or on hardware.

## Earlier — the rebuilt circle

See SESSION-2026-09-13-CIRCLE.md. The circle view was rebuilt around the
sounding record and a real clock of the night, the floating key was removed,
and the controls now fold away with the tab or H. None of it has been seen on
real hardware or judged by ear.

Known gaps: the gallery fullscreen view was not touched and has not been
re-checked under the new design layer; "Class voices: 1" still tells a viewer
nothing; Present/demo mode was not re-examined.

## Earlier — the first interface pass

The interface pass is built and measured but nobody has looked at it. Two ring
conventions changed deliberately (single-group arrivals moved to the outer
ring; shared-minute halos moved from a fixed 0.93 to just outside the
arrivals at 1.04) and a legend was added. SESSION-2026-09-13-RELEASE.md has
the reasoning. Show her the circle before building anything on top of it.

Then: the gallery and Present mode were not re-examined under the new design
layer, and "Class voices: 1" still tells a viewer nothing.

## Standing obligations

Precision policy is still only a proposal. The date diamond still means
"both observed on this date", not shared minutes, and still reads as though it
means the latter. Observer sound identity (Milestone 2), composition
save/reopen (Milestone 4) and gap shortening (Milestone 5) are unstarted.

No listening review, real-device test or long rehearsal has been performed on
the released build. Say so rather than implying otherwise. Warm Noctilucent
remains an unjudged audition at
`../../sessions/2026-09-13/noctilucent-warm/listen.html`.
